**THIS IS A BRUTAL DISSECTION OF VINES.** I'm experimenting with
extracting a slim vines-core with a bunch of gems layered on top of
it. This is totally broken and shouldn't be used by anybody. There are
no working development instructions right now. I suggest starting with
`script/bootstrap && script/tests` if you really must poke around.
